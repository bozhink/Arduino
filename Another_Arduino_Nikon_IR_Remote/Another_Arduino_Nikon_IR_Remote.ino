The IR LED should be connected to pin 3 using a current limiting resistor.

The code uses arduino timer 2 to generate the signal with approximately the right carrier frequency. The timer is running all the time, but PWM output is being turned on/off by setting and resetting the COM2B1 bit.

Note that this code does not just fire a single shot like the original code. It fires a shot every two seconds, so basically we have a simple intervalometer. The time can be changed by varying the amount of time in the delay(2000); statement.

I didn‚Äôt have an IR led on hand, so I tried it out with a red laser module and a blue led (connected in series with a 470 ohm resistor). Lol, when I started experimenting I thought I had an IR led, but the LED I got from an arduino IR transmitter + receiver + led package turned out to be just normal blue led‚Ä¶

Actually I got the camera to fire using a blue led as the emitter, but the range was really small, like 50cm or so. I also tried removing the resistor to get higher current, but that didn‚Äôt increase the range significantly and it may be bad for the LED and the arduino pins.

So here is the selfie an Arduino took. Not much to see actually üôÇ LED is the white spot connected with wires to Arduino.

I have to try this with a real IR led to figure out what range I can achieve. Additionally the modulation depth and frequency could be tuned a bit to get even better range.

Note that there are actually quite a few libraries avaliable for arduino which are specifically made to control the Nikon and other cameras. Using these might be easier than ‚Äúbit banging‚Äù the IR protocol.
